# Security-Checklist
A comprehensive guide to secure coding and cybersecurity best practices.
# Security Checklist

## General Security Practices
- [ ] Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts.
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords (preferably with a password manager).
- [ ] Regularly update software and dependencies.
- [ ] Limit access based on the principle of least privilege.

## Web Application Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- [ ] Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent SQL Injection and XSS.
- [ ] Implement secure session management (e.g., secure cookies, token expiration).
- [ ] Regularly review and rotate API keys and credentials.

## DevSecOps Best Practices
- [ ] Use tools like Dependabot to monitor dependencies.
- [ ] Implement static code analysis in CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] Secure GitHub Actions workflows by using secrets and permissions.

## Cloud Security
- [ ] Restrict public access to storage buckets (e.g., AWS S3).
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring (e.g., AWS CloudTrail).
- [ ] Regularly audit IAM roles and policies.

## Incident Response
- [ ] Create a documented Incident Response Plan.
- [ ] Regularly conduct simulated incident drills.
- [ ] Use tools to monitor and analyze logs for anomalies.
# Input Validation Best Practices

## Why Input Validation Matters
Improper input validation can lead to vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and command injection.

## Best Practices
- Validate inputs on both client-side and server-side.
- Use a whitelist approach: only allow expected input formats.
- Escape special characters when interacting with databases or file systems.
- Use frameworks that provide built-in sanitization functions.

## Tools
- OWASP ZAP: Test for input validation vulnerabilities.
- Burp Suite: Analyze and exploit input fields for testing.
